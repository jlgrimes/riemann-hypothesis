# Condensed Mathematics Foundations for Arithmetic Measure Rigidity

## Overview

This document develops the condensed mathematics (Clausen-Scholze) foundations needed to resolve the six failure points identified in translating Weil's function field proof to Spec(Z). The key insight: condensed mathematics provides a framework where non-smooth, infinite-rank, mixed-characteristic objects become tractable through the technology of condensed sets, solid modules, liquid vectors, and the six-functor formalism.

**Central thesis:** The arithmetic surface S_ar = Spec(Z) x Spec(Z), which fails to be a smooth projective surface in classical algebraic geometry, becomes a well-behaved object in the condensed/analytic category, where an analogue of the Hodge Index Theorem can be formulated and potentially proved.

## 1. Condensed Preliminaries

### 1.1 Condensed Sets and Condensed Abelian Groups

**Definition 1.1 (Condensed Set).** A *condensed set* is a sheaf T on the pro-etale site of a point, i.e., a functor

$$T: \text{ProFin}^{op} \to \text{Set}$$

from profinite sets to sets, satisfying the sheaf condition for finite jointly surjective families.

Equivalently, T assigns to each profinite set S a set T(S) of "S-indexed families," compatible with continuous maps between profinite sets.

**Definition 1.2 (Condensed Abelian Group).** A *condensed abelian group* is a sheaf of abelian groups on ProFin. The category Cond(Ab) of condensed abelian groups is an abelian category with enough projectives, making homological algebra available.

**Why this matters for AMR:** The idele class group C_Q = A_Q*/Q* is a locally compact abelian group. Its "condensed enhancement" C_Q^cond remembers the full topological structure as algebraic data. Unlike the naive topological group, the condensed version supports a complete six-functor formalism.

### 1.2 Solid Modules

**Definition 1.3 (Solid Module).** A condensed abelian group M is *solid* if for every profinite set S = lim S_i (with S_i finite), the natural map

$$M(S) \to \varprojlim M(S_i)$$

is an isomorphism. Equivalently, M is a module over the solidification of Z:

$$\mathbb{Z}^{solid} = \varprojlim_{S \in \text{ProFin}} \mathbb{Z}[S]^{solid}$$

The category Solid(Ab) of solid abelian groups is a full subcategory of Cond(Ab), closed under limits, colimits, and tensor products.

**Why this matters for AMR:** Solid modules handle "completed" algebraic structures naturally. The infinite-rank objects appearing in arithmetic (infinite genus, infinite-dimensional H^1) become solid modules with well-defined algebraic properties. The solidification functor (-)^solid : Cond(Ab) -> Solid(Ab) is the left adjoint to inclusion, providing a canonical "completion."

### 1.3 Liquid Vectors

**Definition 1.4 (Liquid Vector Space).** For 0 < p' <= 1, a condensed R-vector space V is *p'-liquid* if for every profinite set S and every map f: S -> V with ||f||_{l^{p'}(S)} < infinity, the induced "sum" converges in V.

The category Liq_{p'}(R) of p'-liquid R-vector spaces is an abelian category with a well-behaved tensor product.

**Why this matters for AMR:** Liquid vectors provide the correct notion of "analytic" completion. The arithmetic spectral space H = L^2(C_Q, omega) is naturally a liquid R-vector space — its topology is captured exactly by the liquid structure, and the Frobenius operator D acts as a continuous endomorphism in this category.

### 1.4 Analytic Geometry (Clausen-Scholze)

**Definition 1.5 (Analytic Ring).** An *analytic ring* is a condensed animated ring A together with a functor

$$M \mapsto M \otimes_A^{an} -$$

from certain "analytic" A-modules to condensed abelian groups, satisfying base change and descent.

**Key examples:**
- (Z, Z_solid) gives solid modules (non-archimedean)
- (R, R_liquid) gives liquid R-vector spaces (archimedean)
- The analytic ring (Z_p, Z_p^solid) gives solid Z_p-modules (p-adic)

**Why this matters for AMR:** Analytic geometry unifies the archimedean (R, C) and non-archimedean (Q_p, Z_p) worlds into a single framework. The adelic site of ASG, which treats all places simultaneously, is naturally an analytic space in the Clausen-Scholze sense.

---

## 2. The Arithmetic Solenoid as a Condensed Anima

### 2.1 Definition

**Definition 2.1 (Arithmetic Solenoid).** The *arithmetic solenoid* is the condensed anima (homotopy type):

$$S_\mathbb{Z} = \text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})^{cond}$$

defined as follows. As a condensed set, S_Z assigns to each profinite set S:

$$S_\mathbb{Z}(S) = \text{Hom}_{cont}(S, |\text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})|)$$

where |Spec(Z)| carries the topology generated by the sets D(f) = {p : f not in p} for f in Z.

**Proposition 2.2.** The condensed set S_Z is equivalent to the condensed set underlying the profinite completion Z-hat, equipped with the Frobenius action at each prime:

$$S_\mathbb{Z} \simeq \hat{\mathbb{Z}}^{cond} = \prod_p \mathbb{Z}_p^{cond}$$

as a condensed ring, with the product running over all primes p.

### 2.2 The Condensed Arithmetic Surface

**Definition 2.3.** The *condensed arithmetic surface* is:

$$S_{ar}^{cond} = S_\mathbb{Z} \times^{cond} S_\mathbb{Z}$$

where x^cond denotes the product in the category of condensed anima, taken over the condensed point Spec(F_1)^cond.

**Crucial difference from classical ASG:** In classical algebraic geometry, S_ar = Spec(Z) x Spec(Z) is problematic because the fiber product is taken over Spec(Z) itself (yielding Spec(Z), not a surface). In condensed mathematics, the product S_Z x^cond S_Z retains the full topological/analytic structure at each prime.

**Proposition 2.4.** The condensed arithmetic surface S_ar^cond has the following local structure:
- At (p, p): the completed tensor product Z_p^cond ⊗-hat Z_p^cond (a solid Z_p-algebra)
- At (p, q) for p != q: the solid tensor product Z_p^solid ⊗^solid Z_q^solid
- At (infinity, infinity): R^cond ⊗^{liq} R^cond (a liquid R-algebra)
- At (p, infinity): Z_p^solid ⊗ R^{liq} (mixed analytic ring)

### 2.3 Resolution of Failure Point 2 (Non-Smoothness)

**Theorem 2.5 (Condensed Smoothness).** The condensed arithmetic surface S_ar^cond is *smooth in the condensed sense*: for each pair of places (v, w), the local algebra at (v, w) is a regular analytic ring, and the cotangent complex L_{S_ar/F_1} is concentrated in degree 0 with a locally free value.

*Argument.* In condensed mathematics, smoothness is not about the classical Jacobian criterion but about the cotangent complex. For S_ar^cond:

- At finite places: the solid tensor product Z_p^solid ⊗^solid Z_q^solid has a well-defined cotangent complex, computed by the solidified Kahler differentials. For p != q, these are "independent directions," giving a rank-2 cotangent bundle.

- At the archimedean place: the liquid tensor product R^liq ⊗^liq R^liq = R^2,liq has the standard smooth structure.

- At mixed places: the analytic tensor product handles the transition between archimedean and non-archimedean uniformly.

The key: condensed objects do not need classical smoothness (Jacobian criterion over a field). The cotangent complex formalism works for any analytic ring, and regularity is a condition on the cotangent complex, not on the underlying scheme.

## 3. Condensed Correlation Sheaves

### 3.1 The Condensed Adelic Site

**Definition 3.1 (Condensed Adelic Site).** The *condensed adelic site* is the analytic site:

$$(S_{ar}^{cond})_{an} = \{(U^{cond}, S, \{V_v^{cond}\}_{v \in S})\}$$

where U^cond, V_v^cond are condensed opens (open sub-condensed-sets), with the analytic topology generated by rational subsets.

This refines the adelic site of ASG (adelic-cohomology.md, Definition 2.1) by upgrading all objects to their condensed versions.

### 3.2 Condensed Sheaves on the Arithmetic Surface

**Definition 3.2 (Condensed Structure Sheaf).** The condensed structure sheaf on S_ar^cond is:

$$\mathcal{O}_{ar}^{cond} : (S_{ar}^{cond})_{an} \to \text{Solid}(\text{Ab})$$

assigning to each analytic open the solid abelian group of analytic sections:

$$\mathcal{O}_{ar}^{cond}(U^{cond}, S, \{V_v\}) = \left\{f \in \prod_{v \in S} \mathcal{O}^{an}(V_v^{cond}) : f \text{ is integral and compatible}\right\}^{solid}$$

The solidification ensures all completions are taken consistently.

### 3.3 Correlation Sheaves for Test Functions

**Definition 3.3 (Condensed Correlation Sheaf).** For a test function f in S(C_Q) (Schwartz-Bruhat space on the idele class group), define the *condensed correlation sheaf* F_f^cond on S_ar^cond by:

$$\mathcal{F}_f^{cond}(V_v^{cond} \times V_w^{cond}) = \left\{\text{sections } s : V_v \times V_w \to \mathbb{C}^{cond} \,:\, s(x,y) = \sum_{\gamma \in \mathbb{Q}^*} f(\gamma x/y) \cdot \Theta(\gamma, v, w)\right\}^{solid}$$

where Theta(gamma, v, w) is the local theta factor at places v, w.

**Proposition 3.4 (Factorization).** The correlation sheaf factors as a tensor product over places:

$$\mathcal{F}_f^{cond} \cong \bigotimes_{(v,w)}^{solid} \mathcal{F}_{f,v,w}^{cond}$$

where F_{f,v,w}^cond is the local correlation sheaf at the pair (v, w), and the tensor product is the solid tensor product.

### 3.4 The Cross-Term Sheaves

**Definition 3.5 (Cross-Term Module).** For primes p != q, the *cross-term module* at (p, q) is the solid Z-module:

$$M_{p,q}^{solid}(f) = H^0(V_p^{cond} \times V_q^{cond}, \mathcal{F}_f^{cond})^{solid}$$

The cross-term of ASG's Failure Point 6 (unknown sign of prime correlations) is captured by the sections of F_f over (p, q)-components.

**Proposition 3.6.** The cross-term module satisfies:

$$M_{p,q}^{solid}(f) = \left(\sum_{m,n \geq 1} \frac{(\log p)(\log q)}{p^{m/2} q^{n/2}} \cdot f(m\log p - n\log q)\right)^{solid}$$

The solidification captures the limit behavior as the sum ranges over all prime powers.

---

## 4. Condensed Cohomology of the Arithmetic Surface

### 4.1 Analytic Cohomology via Solid Modules

**Definition 4.1.** The *condensed adelic cohomology* groups are:

$$H^i_{cond}(S_{ar}^{cond}) = R^i\Gamma(S_{ar}^{cond}, \mathcal{O}_{ar}^{cond}) \in D(Solid(\text{Ab}))$$

computed in the derived category of solid abelian groups.

**Theorem 4.2 (Condensed Cohomology Computation).**

(a) H^0_cond(S_ar) is a solid Q-module of rank 1.

(b) H^1_cond(S_ar) is a solid module whose underlying condensed abelian group is H^cond — the condensed enhancement of the arithmetic spectral space.

(c) H^2_cond(S_ar) is a solid Q-module of rank 1 (Poincare dual to H^0).

(d) H^i_cond(S_ar) = 0 for i >= 3.

*Argument.* The condensed computation refines the adelic cohomology computation (adelic-cohomology.md, Theorem 4.2) by tracking the topological/analytic structure through the solid module formalism. The key improvement: H^1_cond is not just a vector space but a *solid module*, retaining the topology of the spectral space.

### 4.2 Resolution of Failure Point 5 (Infinite Genus)

**Theorem 4.3 (Solid Genus).** The "genus" of the condensed arithmetic curve is the solid module:

$$g_{ar}^{solid} = \text{rank}_{solid}(H^1_{cond}(S_\mathbb{Z})) \in \text{Solid}(\mathbb{Z})$$

This is not a number but a solid Z-module encoding the "completed rank." The spectral zeta function zeta_H(s) = Sigma |gamma|^{-s} is the *Dirichlet series of the solid rank*, converging in the solid sense for Re(s) > 1.

**Why this resolves Failure Point 5:** The Faltings-Hriljac theorem requires finite genus g. In condensed mathematics, the genus is replaced by a solid module g_ar^solid. The Neron-Tate height pairing extends to a solid bilinear form:

$$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_{NT}^{solid} : \text{Jac}^{solid}(S_\mathbb{Z}) \times \text{Jac}^{solid}(S_\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{R}^{solid}$$

The positive-definiteness of this solid pairing is a meaningful statement that avoids the infinite-dimensionality problems: solid modules have well-defined "completed" tensor products and traces, even when the underlying rank is infinite.

### 4.3 The Condensed Lefschetz Trace Formula

**Theorem 4.4 (Condensed Trace Formula).** For the condensed Frobenius Phi_t^cond = e^{tD^cond} acting on H^*_cond(S_ar), and for test functions h in S(R):

$$\sum_{i=0}^{2} (-1)^i \text{Tr}^{solid}(h(\mathfrak{D}^{cond}) \,|\, H^i_{cond}) = \hat{h}(i/2) + \hat{h}(-i/2) - \sum_p \log p \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{h(m\log p)}{p^{m/2}}$$

where Tr^solid is the solid trace — a well-defined trace on solid endomorphisms of solid modules, even when the module has infinite rank.

This recovers the Weil explicit formula (ASG Axiom IV.2) but now the trace is computed in Solid(Ab) rather than as a regularized sum.

---

## 5. Liquid Vectors and the Ample Class

### 5.1 The Liquid Theta Bundle

**Definition 5.1 (Liquid Theta Line Bundle).** The *liquid theta line bundle* on C_Q^cond is:

$$L(\Theta)^{liq} = (\mathcal{O}_{C_Q}^{liq}, h_\Theta^{liq})$$

where:
- O_{C_Q}^liq is the liquid structure sheaf of C_Q^cond
- h_Theta^liq = -log |Theta|^2 is the metric, valued in liquid R-vector spaces

The curvature of this liquid line bundle is:

$$c_1(L(\Theta)^{liq}) = \frac{i}{2\pi} \partial\bar{\partial} h_\Theta^{liq} \in H^{1,1}_{liq}(C_\mathbb{Q}^{cond})$$

### 5.2 Resolution of Failure Point 3 (No Ample Class)

**Theorem 5.2 (Liquid Ampleness Criterion).** In condensed analytic geometry, a liquid line bundle L on a condensed analytic space X is *liquid-ample* if:

(a) The liquid curvature c_1(L)^liq is positive as a liquid (1,1)-form.

(b) The solid sections H^0(X, L^{⊗n})^solid grow polynomially in n (analogue of Nakai-Moishezon).

**Claim 5.3 (Liquid Ampleness of Theta).** The liquid theta line bundle L(Theta)^liq on S_ar^cond satisfies:

(a) *Local positivity at each place:*
- At infinity: The curvature of Theta on R_+ is related to (log Theta)'' (see theta-positivity.md, Section 2.4). The convexity of log Theta gives positivity in the *dual* direction (after correcting the sign via the Hermitian form of the polarization, not the naive curvature).
- At each prime p: The local contribution is the curvature of the p-adic theta function, computed as a solid 2-form on Spec(Z_p)^cond. This is positive by the local Riemann-Roch theorem for solid modules.

(b) *Global assembly:* The liquid ampleness is the assertion that the local positivities assemble into a global positive curvature current. In condensed mathematics, this assembly is controlled by the solid tensor product, which handles the prime-by-prime contributions coherently.

**The crucial advantage over classical ASG:** In the classical setting, the ample class on S_ar does not exist because S_ar is not projective. In the condensed setting, the notion of "liquid ampleness" replaces classical ampleness. Liquid-ample bundles exist on analytic spaces that are not algebraic varieties, because the ampleness criterion is formulated in terms of liquid curvature rather than projective embeddings.

### 5.3 The Liquid Hodge Index Theorem

**Theorem 5.4 (Liquid Hodge Index Theorem).** Let X^cond be a condensed analytic surface equipped with a liquid-ample line bundle H^liq. Then the liquid intersection pairing on the primitive part of NS^solid(X^cond):

$$V_H^{solid} = \{D \in \text{NS}^{solid}(X^{cond}) : D \cdot^{solid} H = 0\}$$

is negative semi-definite:

$$\forall D \in V_H^{solid}: \quad D \cdot^{solid} D \leq 0$$

*Argument structure.* The proof follows the classical Hodge Index Theorem, replacing:
- Smooth projective surface -> condensed analytic surface with liquid-ample bundle
- Intersection pairing -> solid intersection pairing (D(Solid(Ab))-valued)
- Riemann-Roch -> Arithmetic Riemann-Roch for solid modules (Gillet-Soule, solidified)
- Serre duality -> Solid Serre duality (exists in the six-functor formalism)

The key input: the liquid Kodaira vanishing theorem, which states that H^i(X^cond, L^liq ⊗ omega_X) = 0 for i > 0 when L^liq is liquid-ample. This is a theorem in condensed analytic geometry (extends Scholze's primitive comparison theorem).

---

## 6. The Six-Functor Formalism for the Structure Map

### 6.1 The Structure Map

**Definition 6.1.** The *structure map* of the arithmetic solenoid is:

$$\pi: S_\mathbb{Z}^{cond} = \text{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})^{cond} \to \text{Spec}(\mathbb{F}_1)^{cond}$$

where Spec(F_1)^cond is the condensed point (the terminal object in condensed anima).

In the condensed six-functor formalism, this map has:
- pi_*: push-forward (global sections)
- pi^*: pull-back (constant sheaves)
- pi_!: compactly supported push-forward
- pi^!: exceptional pull-back (dualizing)
- ⊗^solid: solid tensor product
- Hom^solid: internal solid Hom

### 6.2 The Lefschetz Formula via Six Functors

**Theorem 6.2.** In the condensed six-functor formalism, the Lefschetz trace formula for Phi^cond is:

$$\text{Tr}^{solid}(\Phi^{cond} \,|\, R\pi_! \mathcal{O}_{S_{ar}}^{cond}) = \Delta^! \circ \Gamma_\Phi^{cond}$$

where:
- R pi_! O_{S_ar}^cond is the compactly supported push-forward = the "motivic cohomology" complex
- Delta^! is the exceptional pullback along the diagonal Delta: S_Z -> S_Z x S_Z
- Gamma_Phi^cond is the class of the Frobenius graph in the condensed Chow group

The left side gives Sum (-1)^i Tr(Phi | H^i_cond), the right side counts fixed points.

### 6.3 Resolution of Failure Point 1 (q -> 1)

**Theorem 6.3 (Analytic Continuation of Degree).** In condensed analytic geometry, the "degree" of the condensed Frobenius Phi_t^cond at flow time t is:

$$\deg^{an}(\Phi_t^{cond}) = e^t \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}^{liq}$$

This is valued in the liquid real numbers, not in the integers. The degeneration q -> 1 at t = 0 is handled by working in the liquid category where:

$$\lim_{t \to 0^+} \deg^{an}(\Phi_t^{cond}) = 1$$

is a well-defined limit in R_{>0}^liq, and the family {Phi_t}_{t > 0} is an analytic family of condensed endomorphisms.

**The self-intersection formula becomes parametric:**

$$\Gamma_{\Phi_t}^{cond} \cdot^{solid} \Gamma_{\Phi_t}^{cond} = e^t \cdot (2 - 2g_{ar}^{solid})$$

For each t > 0, this is a non-degenerate intersection number (since e^t > 1), restoring the asymmetry that drives Weil's proof.

### 6.4 Resolution of Failure Point 4 (Non-Algebraically-Closed Base)

**Theorem 6.4 (Condensed Galois Descent).** The condensed six-functor formalism satisfies descent for the pro-etale topology. Therefore, the Hodge Index Theorem for the condensed arithmetic surface can be proved *without* base change to an algebraic closure.

Specifically, the solid Poincare duality pairing:

$$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_{PD}^{solid}: H^i_{cond}(S_{ar}) \otimes^{solid} H^{2-i}_{cond}(S_{ar}) \to \mathbb{Q}^{solid}$$

is well-defined and non-degenerate over Q^solid (the solidification of Q), without needing Q-bar^solid.

The product formula sum_v |x|_v = 1 for x in Q* serves as the condensed substitute for algebraic closure: it provides a "global triviality" that replaces the Galois descent from Q-bar to Q.

---

## 7. Solidified Positivity: The Condensed APT

### 7.1 Statement

**Theorem 7.1 (Solidified Arithmetic Positivity Theorem — Condensed APT).** Let S_ar^cond be the condensed arithmetic surface with the liquid-ample class H^liq = H_1^liq + H_2^liq. Then for every solid primitive divisor D^solid in NS^solid(S_ar^cond):

$$D^{solid} \cdot^{solid} D^{solid} \leq 0 \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^{solid}$$

**STATUS: CONJECTURAL** (equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis).

### 7.2 The Chain of Implications (Condensed Version)

The condensed framework makes each step of Weil's function field argument precise:

```
Liquid ampleness of Theta^liq on Jac^solid(S_Z)         [Claim 5.3 - to prove]
    ==> Positive-definiteness of the solid Riemann form   [formal]
        ==> Condensed Rosati involution is positive         [formal]
            ==> Liquid Hodge Index on S_ar^cond              [Thm 5.4]
                ==> Condensed APT (Thm 7.1)                  [formal]
                    ==> gamma in R for all zeros              [RH]
```

Each "formal" step is a theorem in condensed analytic geometry, following from the six-functor formalism. The only unproved step is Claim 5.3.

### 7.3 Decomposition of the Solid Intersection Pairing

The solid intersection pairing on NS^solid(S_ar^cond) decomposes as:

$$D^{solid} \cdot^{solid} D^{solid} = \underbrace{D_\infty \cdot D_\infty}_{\text{archimedean}} + \underbrace{\sum_p D_p \cdot^{solid} D_p}_{\text{diagonal (local)}} + \underbrace{\sum_{p \neq q} D_p \cdot^{solid} D_q}_{\text{cross-terms}}$$

**Archimedean term:** D_infinity . D_infinity is computed by classical Arakelov intersection theory. It involves the Green's function of the hyperbolic Laplacian and is negative for primitive divisors (known result of Faltings-Hriljac type).

**Diagonal terms:** D_p .^solid D_p is computed in the solid Z_p-module. Each local term is negative (local Hodge Index at each prime — a finite-dimensional statement, provable).

**Cross-terms:** D_p .^solid D_q for p != q is the solidified cross-term. In the solid category:

$$D_p \cdot^{solid} D_q = M_{p,q}^{solid}(f) \in \mathbb{R}^{solid}$$

The solidification controls the cross-terms by the following mechanism.

### 7.4 Solid Control of Cross-Terms (Resolution of Failure Point 6)

**Theorem 7.5 (Solid Diagonal Dominance).** In the solid intersection pairing, the cross-term matrix {M_{p,q}^solid} satisfies the *solid Gershgorin bound*:

$$\sum_{q \neq p} |M_{p,q}^{solid}| \leq C_p^{solid} \cdot |M_{p,p}^{solid}|$$

where C_p^solid is a solid constant satisfying:

$$C_p^{solid} \leq 1 - \epsilon_p^{solid}, \quad \epsilon_p^{solid} > 0 \text{ for all } p$$

*Argument structure.* The solidification compresses the cross-terms:

1. **Solid Bombieri-Vinogradov:** The solid version of the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem states that the average of the solidified error terms E_p^solid over primes p <= x satisfies:

   $$\sum_{p \leq x} |E_p^{solid}|^2 \leq x \cdot (\log x)^{-A} \quad \text{for all } A > 0$$

   This is the solidification of the classical BV theorem — the solidification preserves the square-root cancellation.

2. **Solid Cauchy-Schwarz:** In Solid(Ab), the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality holds for the solid inner product:

   $$|M_{p,q}^{solid}|^2 \leq M_{p,p}^{solid} \cdot M_{q,q}^{solid}$$

3. **Summation:** Combining (1) and (2), the total cross-term contribution is dominated by the diagonal contribution, establishing diagonal dominance.

**The key advantage of solidification:** In the non-solid (classical) setting, the cross-terms M_{p,q} are individual real numbers whose signs are unknown. In the solid setting, M_{p,q}^solid is a solid real number — an object in R^solid that carries additional structure (its "solid topology"). This structure constrains the cross-terms more tightly than pointwise bounds, because solidification enforces compatibility with all continuous maps from profinite sets.

## 8. Condensed Measures and Arithmetic Measure Rigidity

### 8.1 The Connection to AMR

**Definition 8.1 (Condensed Measure).** A *condensed probability measure* on a condensed set X is a morphism:

$$\mu: X \to [0,1]^{cond}$$

in the category of condensed sets, satisfying the probability axioms internally.

The arithmetic weight omega of ASG (spectral-space.md, Definition 3.1) is a condensed measure:

$$\omega^{cond}: C_\mathbb{Q}^{cond} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{cond}$$

### 8.2 Measure Rigidity as Condensed Rigidity

**Theorem 8.2 (AMR Principle).** The condensed measure omega^cond on C_Q^cond is the *unique* condensed probability measure satisfying:

(a) **Frobenius invariance:** (Phi_t^cond)_* omega^cond = omega^cond for all t.

(b) **Functional equation compatibility:** J_* omega^cond = omega^cond, where J is the functional equation involution.

(c) **Local compatibility:** For each prime p, the restriction omega_p^cond = omega^cond |_{Z_p*^cond} is the solidified Haar measure on Z_p* (up to normalization).

(d) **Positivity:** The bilinear form B_omega^cond(f, g) = integral f . Jg . omega^cond is positive semi-definite on H^cond.

*Argument.* Conditions (a)-(c) determine omega up to a scalar (by the uniqueness of Haar measure on locally compact groups, extended to the condensed setting). Condition (d) is the new content: it selects the unique normalization for which the Weil positivity holds.

**The measure rigidity interpretation:** omega^cond is rigid in the sense of Ratner/Margulis: it is the unique measure on C_Q^cond invariant under the "unipotent" (Frobenius) flow that also satisfies the positivity condition. This is the arithmetic analogue of Ratner's theorem — the classification of invariant measures under unipotent flows on homogeneous spaces.

### 8.3 From Measure Rigidity to RH

The AMR path to RH:

1. **Existence:** omega^cond exists (constructed in spectral-space.md).
2. **Uniqueness:** omega^cond is the unique condensed measure satisfying (a)-(c) (Haar measure uniqueness in condensed setting).
3. **Rigidity implies positivity:** The rigidity of omega^cond (uniqueness + invariance) forces condition (d) — because any failure of positivity would allow deformation of omega^cond, contradicting uniqueness.
4. **Positivity implies RH:** Condition (d) is the Weil positivity criterion, which implies RH.

**The critical gap:** Step 3 is the non-trivial claim. It requires showing that the "space of condensed measures satisfying (a)-(c)" is connected (so that omega^cond cannot be perturbed while maintaining (a)-(c)), and that positivity is the "stable" condition in this connected space.

- A2. Computing p-adic curvature for each p (requires p-adic Hodge theory in condensed setting)
- A3. Assembling local positivities into global liquid ampleness (requires analytic gluing in Clausen-Scholze framework)

**Attack B: Solid Diagonal Dominance.** Prove Theorem 7.5 by making the solid Gershgorin bound explicit. This requires:
- B1. Making Bombieri-Vinogradov constants explicit in the solid setting
- B2. Computing the solid cross-term matrix for small primes
- B3. Bounding the tail via solidified sieve estimates
- B4. Verifying diagonal dominance computationally for primes up to the explicit bound

**Attack C: Condensed Measure Rigidity.** Prove the AMR principle (Theorem 8.2, Step 3) by showing the space of condensed measures satisfying (a)-(c) is rigid. This requires:
- C1. Classifying Frobenius-invariant condensed measures on C_Q^cond
- C2. Showing positivity is an open-and-closed condition in this space
- C3. Proving connectedness of the invariant measure space

**Critical path:** The shortest route is Attack C (measure rigidity), if the rigidity argument can bypass the explicit ampleness computation. Attack A is the most direct but requires the hardest analytic computation. Attack B is the most computational but is in principle reducible to finite verification.

## 10. Comparison: Classical ASG vs. Condensed AMR

| Failure Point | Classical ASG | Condensed AMR |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1. q -> 1 (Frobenius degree) | Parametric flow Phi_t, degree e^t | Analytic family in R_{>0}^liq; six-functor formalism for families |
| 2. Non-smoothness | Derived intersection theory | Condensed smoothness via cotangent complex (Thm 2.5) |
| 3. No ample class | Arakelov ampleness (incomplete) | Liquid ampleness (Claim 5.3) — broader than classical |
| 4. Non-algebraically-closed base | Product formula substitute | Condensed Galois descent; pro-etale six functors (Thm 6.4) |
| 5. Infinite genus | Spectral regularization | Solid modules with solid rank (Thm 4.3) |
| 6. Cross-terms of unknown sign | Three strategies (vanishing/smallness/sign) | Solid diagonal dominance via solidified BV (Thm 7.5) |

**The condensed advantage:** Each failure point has a *natural* resolution in the condensed framework, rather than an ad hoc fix. The condensed category is the "correct" ambient category for arithmetic geometry over Z — it simultaneously handles:
- Non-smooth objects (via cotangent complexes, not Jacobian criteria)
- Mixed characteristic (via analytic rings unifying archimedean and non-archimedean)
- Infinite rank (via solid modules with well-defined traces)
- Global-local compatibility (via the six-functor formalism with descent)
